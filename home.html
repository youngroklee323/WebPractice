      <h3>what is elite dangerous?</h3>
      <p>Elite Dangerous is a massively multiplayer space epic and the fourth installment in the legendary Elite series, the longest running space simulation series in history.[1] It was developed and published by Frontier Developments with David Braben as the director. The Windows PC version launched on December 16, 2014. It was partially funded via a Kickstarter campaign.[2] The Mac version was released on May 12, 2015,[3] but Mac OS support was dropped on December 11, 2018 due to technical barriers.[4] The Xbox One version launched on October 6, 2015,[5] followed by the PlayStation 4 version on June 27, 2017.[6] The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions can be played on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 respectively via backwards compatibility,[7][8] but no new ports optimized specifically for next-generation consoles are currently planned.[9]</p>
