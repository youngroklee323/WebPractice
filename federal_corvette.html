The Federal Corvette is one of the most powerful combat ships on the market. With a total of seven hardpoints, the ship has few rivals in terms of damage output, and is remarkably manoeuvrable given its size. Despite its comparatively small jump range, owning a Corvette is the ultimate ambition of many independent combat pilots, its astonishing power making it one of the most formidable vessels in the galaxy.
